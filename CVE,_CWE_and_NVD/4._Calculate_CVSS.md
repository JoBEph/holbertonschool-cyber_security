# Mastering Risk Assessment: A CVSS Calculation Walkthrough

  

In cybersecurity, identifying a vulnerability is only the first step. The real challenge is quantifying the risk. The **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** provides a numerical representation of a threat severity, helping organizations decide how to react.

Today, we will calculate the score for a common but dangerous scenario: a **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerability.

  

### The Scenario: Web Server Remote Code Execution

Imagine a vulnerability in a popular web server. It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely. The attacker does not need a password or any specific user help to trigger the flaw.

  

### 1\. Identifying the Base Metrics

To calculate the score, we evaluate the fundamental characteristics of the vulnerability using the CVSS v3.1 framework:

-   **Attack Vector (AV): Network.** The attack can be launched from anywhere in the world over the internet.
-   **Attack Complexity (AC): Low.** No special conditions or advanced techniques are required to exploit the flaw.
-   **Privileges Required (PR): None.** The attacker does not need an account or administrative rights.
-   **User Interaction (UI): None.** The exploit happens automatically without a user clicking a link or opening a file.
-   **Scope (S): Unchanged.** The exploited vulnerability affects the web server itself.
-   **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): High.** An RCE usually allows a full takeover, meaning all data can be stolen (C), modified (I), and the service can be shut down (A).

  

### 2\. The Calculation and Score

Using the CVSS v3.1 formula, these metrics produce a powerful result:

-   **CVSS Base Score: 9.8**
-   **Severity Level: Critical**

As established in our severity scale, any score between **9.0 and 10.0** is classified as **Critical**, representing the highest possible level of risk to an organization.

### 3\. Implications for Security Posture

A score of **9.8** has massive implications for an organization:

-   **Immediate Exposure:** Because the Attack Vector is "Network" and Privileges are "None," anyone on the internet can potentially take control of the server.
-   **Total Compromise:** Since the Impact metrics (C, I, A) are all "High," a successful exploit leads to a total loss of control over the affected system and the data it holds.
-   **Resource Drain:** A "Critical" vulnerability often triggers an "all hands on deck" response, diverting IT and security staff from all other projects until the issue is resolved.

  

### 4\. Recommended Mitigation Strategies

Because this is a **Critical** vulnerability, a standard "wait for the next update" approach is insufficient. The following steps are recommended:

-   **Immediate Patching:** This is the primary defense. If a vendor patch is available, it must be applied within 24 to 48 hours.
-   **Virtual Patching:** If a permanent patch cannot be applied immediately, use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to block the specific attack patterns associated with this CVE.
-   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the affected web server from the internal network. This ensures that even if the server is compromised, the attacker cannot "jump" to more sensitive internal databases.
-   **Service Disruption:** If no patch or mitigation exists, the organization may need to temporarily take the service offline to protect its data.

  

### Conclusion

A CVSS score of 9.8 is a clear signal for urgent action. By breaking down the metrics, we understand not just that a bug is "bad," but exactly why it is dangerous and how we can stop it.
