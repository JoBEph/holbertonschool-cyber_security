# From Theory to Practice: Common CWEs and How to Prioritize Them

  

Every day, developers unintentionally introduce weaknesses into their code. By understanding the most frequent types of flaws, known as **CWEs (Common Weakness Enumerations)**, teams can better protect their software and their users.

Here, we look at some of the most common weaknesses and how to handle them effectively during a project.

  

### Common CWE Examples and Their Impact

To understand the risks, we must look at the "Root Cause" of the most frequent security failures:

-   **CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection)**
-   **The Flaw:** This happens when user-supplied data is sent to a database without being cleaned first.
-   **The Impact:** An attacker can steal, modify, or delete the entire database, leading to massive data breaches and loss of sensitive information.
-   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-Site Scripting or XSS)**
-   **The Flaw:** Malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users.
-   **The Impact:** Attackers can steal session cookies, impersonate users, or deface websites. It directly compromises the trust between the user and the application.
-   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (Path Traversal)**
-   **The Flaw:** An application uses user input to construct a path to a file on the server without properly validating the input.
-   **The Impact:** This can allow an attacker to access sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, password files, or source code.

  

### How to Prioritize Weaknesses in a Project

In a complex software project, you cannot fix everything at once. Prioritization is key to maintaining a strong security posture. Here is a three-step strategy for addressing CWEs:

**1\. Use the CWE Top 25** Every year, the community publishes a list of the "Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses." These are flaws that are both easy to find and have a high impact. Developers should always prioritize fixing any weakness that appears on this list, as they are the most likely targets for hackers.

**2\. Evaluate Exposure and Business Impact** Not all weaknesses are equally dangerous in every context. Prioritize weaknesses based on:

-   **Accessibility:** Is the weakness in a public-facing part of the app (like a login page) or an internal tool?
-   **Data Sensitivity:** Does the weakness provide access to credit card numbers or just public metadata? Always fix the flaws that sit on the "front door" of your application first.

**3\. Categorize by Remediation Effort** Sometimes, a "High" impact weakness is very easy to fix (such as updating a library), while a "Medium" weakness requires a total rewrite of the architecture. Prioritize the "Quick Wins" where high security gain can be achieved with low effort, then schedule the larger architectural changes into your development roadmap.

  

### Conclusion

Understanding CWEs allows developers to look past individual bugs and see the patterns that lead to insecurity. By focusing on high-impact weaknesses like SQL Injection and Path Traversal, and using a structured prioritization strategy, teams can build software that is secure by design rather than by accident.
