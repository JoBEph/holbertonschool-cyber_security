### Behind the ID: How the CVE List is Built and Managed

  

Have you ever wondered how a software bug transforms into a globally recognized ID like CVE-2025–1234? This process isn't random, it is a highly coordinated effort between private companies, researchers, and government agencies.

  

### Who Manages the CVE List?

The CVE Program is a community-driven effort overseen by the **CVE Board**, which includes representatives from major security companies, academia, and government.

While the board sets the strategy, the “heavy lifting” is handled by two key groups:

·       **The MITRE Corporation:** Acting as the primary **Secretariat**, MITRE maintains the core infrastructure and the master list.

·       **CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency):** Along with MITRE, CISA acts as a **Top-Level Root**, helping to govern the program and ensure it meets the security needs of the global community.

### The Role of CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs)

The CVE program follows a decentralized “federated” model. Instead of one single office assigning every ID, the power is distributed to **CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs)**.

CNAs are authorized organizations — including vendors like Microsoft, Google, and Red Hat, as well as security researchers and bug bounty platforms — that assign CVE IDs within a specific **scope** (usually their own products or research areas).

By distributing this responsibility, the program can scale to handle the thousands of new vulnerabilities discovered every year.

  

### The Process: From Discovery to Publication

Assigning a CVE ID follows a strict lifecycle to ensure accuracy and prevent duplicates:

1.    **Discovery & Reporting:** A researcher or developer finds a security flaw and reports it to the relevant CNA (for example, reporting a Windows bug to Microsoft).

2.    **Reservation:** The CNA evaluates the report. If it qualifies as a legitimate, unique vulnerability, the CNA “reserves” a CVE ID. At this stage, the ID exists but details are often kept private while a fix is developed.

3.    **Submission:** Once a patch is ready, the CNA populates the **CVE Record** with technical details: the affected versions, a description of the flaw, and public references (like a security advisory).

4.    **Publication:** The CNA submits the record to the CVE List. It is now public and can be synced by security tools and databases (like the NVD) worldwide.

  

### Conclusion

The CVE list is a testament to global cooperation. By empowering CNAs to manage vulnerabilities within their own expertise, the CVE Program ensures that the world has a fast, accurate, and standardized way to track digital threats.
